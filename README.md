# PyOS
PyOS, an operating system based to the PyUI Module.

After download, place all of the files into ONE empty folder. Then run the PyOS.py file, if the module succeeds to import the PyOS module (+additional modules required, see code for detail) then PyOS should function!

NOTE:

- PyOS is in early betas so you may encounter bugs.
- PyOS may also lack features due to how new it is.

Thank you and enjoy!
